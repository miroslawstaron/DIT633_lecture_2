/*
 * This program demonstrates how to work with bits and bytes in DIT632.
 * The goal is to demonstrate how we can do bit arithmetic and what bits are bytes are
 *
 * For this demo, we will need the following:
 * - understand what #define preprocessor directive does - from lecture 1
 * - know what a bit and a byte are - from the Java programming course
 * - know how to use formatting strings for printf - from lecture 1
 * - know that everything in C start from 0, not from 1
 * - a good thing is to have the ASCII table at hand: https://www.asciitable.com/

 /*
  * Basics:
  * 1 byte = 8 bits
  * We usually use hexadecimal numbers for bytes and binary for bits
  * we denote a hexadecimal number by writing 0x before the number,
  * for example:
  *      0x00 == decimal 0
  *      0x01 == decimal 1
  *      0x0A == decimal 10
  *      0x10 == decimal 16
  *
  * we use 0b to denote binary numbers,
  * for example:
  *      0b00000000 == decimal 0
  *      0b00000001 == decimal 1
  *
  * 0x00 == 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 == 0b00000000 == decimal 0
  * 0x01 == 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 == 0b00000001 == decimal 1
  * 0x02 == 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 == 0b00000010 == decimal 2
  * 0x0F == 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 == 0b00001111 == decimal 15

  // bit1 is the value of the first bit in a byte
  // the first bit is the same as 2^0= 1 - two to the power of zero (first bit)
  // this value is sometimes called a mask
  // a mask can be used to check if a particular bit is set
  // a bit is set if its value == 1
  // bit1 = 0b 0000 0001 * 2 = 0b 0000 0010 
#define bit1 0b1

// bit2 is the value of the second bit
// the value is 2 = 2*1
#define bit2 0x02

// bit3 is the value of the third bit
// the value is 2^2 = 4
#define bit3 0b100
#define bit4 8
#define bit5 0b10000
#define bit6 32
#define bit7 64
#define bit8 128

// here, we defined a new type - byte
// that type is the same as unsigned char

    // Hello world!
    // a good practice is to print something at the beginning of the program
    // so that we know that we start.
    printf("Welcome to the binary numbers demonstration! \n");

    // there is no bit or byte type in C
    // We use char as the type for one byte, for example

    // this means that I want the compiler to treat this variable
    // as pure byte, not in U2 binary conding system
    // unsigned char one_byte;

    byte one_byte;

    // when we assign the value, however, we need to convert the type
    // for example like this:
    one_byte = (byte) 20;

    // we can also print it directly as a value
    // please note that we use %d as the formatting string here
    printf("This is the value of one_byte %d\n", one_byte);

    // TODO: change that to %c and see what happens

    // decimal 20 == 0x14 == 0b 0001 0100
	// decimal 66 == 0x42 == 0b 0100 0010

    // now, about bit masking
    // the expression in this statement
    // means that we check whether one_byte has bits 3 and 5 set to 1
    // and all the rest of the bits set to 0
	// bit3 ==        0b 0000 0100

    printf("Value of the bit_8_is_not_set is: %d\n", bit_8_is_not_set);

    // Finally, let's shift some bits around in a byte
    // let's say we have number 1
    // let's use hexadecimal notation to make it more interesting
    byte number_one = bit1; // == 0b0000 0001

    // let's see what we get:

    // now, let's shift the bits of that number to the left
    number_one = number_one << 1;
	// 0b0000 0001 << 1 == 0b0000 0010

    // let's see what we get:

    printf("Value of number_one after shifting bits is: %d\n", number_one);

    // let's do that one more time:

    number_one = number_one << 1;

    // let's see what we get:

    // how about we shift it 2 bits to the right
    // we should get: 0b00000100 >> 2 = 0b000000001
    number_one = number_one >> 2;
    

    // let's see what we get
    printf("Value of number_one after shifting 2 bits to the right is: %x\n", number_one);


    // printf to say goodbye
    printf("%s\n", "That's all for this demo, thank you for watching!");
